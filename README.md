ProLM: A proteomics foundation model for general population
====
ProLM is a pre-trained language model based on the plasma proteome of healthy individuals. Users can perform downstream tasks according to their own needs. We have provided the main code for pre-training and fine-tuning. The weights of the pre-trained model are saved at https://figshare.com/s/d282e0213672e2666a76.
