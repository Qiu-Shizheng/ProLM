A proteomic language model for chronic disease prediction and risk stratification
====
ProLM is a pre-trained language model based on the plasma proteome of healthy individuals. Users can perform downstream tasks according to their own needs. We have provided the main code for pre-training and fine-tuning, while the remaining plotting code will be made publicly available after the article is published.
